/*
 * This code explains the memory storage of an ArrayList in Java.
 *
 * The ArrayList stores its elements in a backing array, which dynamically grows as elements are added.
 * When the capacity of the backing array is reached, it is resized by creating a new larger array and copying elements.
 *
 * The ArrayList maintains two variables: capacity (the total capacity of the backing array) and size (the number of elements).
 *
 * Memory is allocated for the backing array when the ArrayList is created.
 * Resizing the array incurs a performance cost, so the ArrayList internally uses a resizing strategy to reduce frequent resizing.
 *
 * Understanding the memory storage of ArrayList is important for optimizing memory usage and performance.
