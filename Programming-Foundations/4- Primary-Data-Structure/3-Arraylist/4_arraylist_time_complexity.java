/* 
*  The time complexity of various operations in an `ArrayList` helps in understanding their
*   efficiency when dealing with different sizes of data. 
*   Here's a general overview of the time complexities for common operations in an `ArrayList`:
*  
*  1. **Access Operations**:
*     - **get(index)**: O(1) - Constant time complexity for accessing an element by index since
*       it directly computes the position in the underlying array.
*     - **set(index, element)**: O(1) - Similar to `get()`, updating an element at a specific 
*      index is also constant time.
*  
*  2. **Add/Remove Operations**:
*     - **add(element)**: O(1) amortized, but can be O(n) worst-case. Adding an element at 
*      the end usually takes constant time due to appending, but resizing the internal array 
*      when it reaches capacity can take O(n) time in certain cases.
*     - **add(index, element)**: O(n) - Adding an element at a specific index might require 
*      shifting subsequent elements, resulting in linear time complexity as it involves copying elements.
*     - **remove(index)**: O(n) - Similar to `add(index)`, removing an element at a specific 
*      index requires shifting subsequent elements, resulting in linear time.
*     - **remove(element)**: O(n) - Removing an element by value involves finding the element (
*      O(n)) and then possibly shifting subsequent elements.
*  
*  3. **Search Operations**:
*     - **indexOf(element)**: O(n) - It searches for the first occurrence of the specified 
*      element by iterating through the list.
*     - **contains(element)**: O(n) - Similar to `indexOf()`, it searches for the element 
*      by iterating through the list.
*  
*  4. **Miscellaneous**:
*     - **size()**: O(1) - Constant time complexity to retrieve the number of elements in the list.
*     - **isEmpty()**: O(1) - Similar to `size()`, it returns true if the list is empty.
*  
*  The time complexities mentioned are general cases and might vary based on the specific 
*      implementation and circumstances. 
*      For instance, adding an element at the end might have O(1) amortized time because of 
*      resizing strategies to accommodate more elements efficiently.
*  
*  Understanding the time complexities helps in selecting the right data structure for 
*  specific use cases, especially when dealing with large datasets where efficiency matters.
