        <h1>CSS Fundamentals Course</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
        <p>
            A selector in CSS is a pattern that defines which HTML elements on a
            web page will be styled by a set of CSS rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Selectors target specific elements based on various criteria,
                such as element type, class, ID, or their relationship with
                other elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS selectors play a crucial role in styling and formatting web
                pages by allowing developers to apply styles selectively to
                different parts of the HTML document.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS provides a variety of selectors, including element
                selectors, class selectors (denoted by a period .), ID selectors
                (denoted by a hash #), and more advanced selectors like
                attribute selectors and pseudo-classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                These selectors enable precise targeting of elements for styling
                purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Understanding and using CSS selectors is fundamental for
                effective web development and design, allowing developers to
                create visually appealing and well-structured interfaces
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong> is the CSS Rule?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A CSS rule is a combination of a selector and a declaration
                block that defines how a specific set of HTML elements should be
                styled.
            </li>
            <li>
                The selector indicates which HTML elements the rule applies to,
                and the declaration block contains one or more declarations,
                each consisting of a CSS property and its corresponding value.
            </li>
            <li>
                These declarations specify the visual presentation of the
                selected elements, such as color, size, or positioning.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inline, Internal and Extrnal</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Inline, Internal, and External CSS?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Definition: Inline CSS is applied directly to a single HTML
                    element, using the style attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scope: It affects only the specific element it is applied
                    to.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Internal CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Definition: Internal CSS is defined within the HTML document
                    using the style tag in the head section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scope: It applies styles to elements on the same page and is
                    not limited to a single element
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>External CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Definition: External CSS is stored in a separate file and
                    linked to the HTML document using the <link /> tag
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scope: It can be applied across multiple pages, promoting a
                    consistent style for the entire website
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What is Separation of Concerns?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a fundamental design principle in
            computer science and software development. It involves breaking a
            computer program or system into distinct and independent sections,
            with each section addressing a specific concern or aspect of
            functionality. The goal is to organize and manage complexity by
            isolating different aspects of the software, making it easier to
            understand, maintain, and scale
        </p>

        <p>Key points about Separation of Concerns include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Distinct Sections: The principle advocates for separating the
                codebase into well-defined sections, each handling specific
                responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preventing High Coupling: SoC helps prevent high coupling
                between different components, allowing changes in one section
                without affecting others
            </li>
            <li>
                Modularity: It promotes modularity, making it easier to develop,
                test, and maintain individual modules or components
            </li>
            <li>
                Readability and Maintainability: By organizing code based on
                concerns, it enhances code readability and makes maintenance
                more straightforward.
            </li>
        </ul>

                >What Does “Don’t Repeat Yourself” Mean in Programming?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) is a software development principle
            that encourages developers to avoid duplicating code. The core idea
            is to write code in a way that eliminates redundancy and promotes
            code reuse
        </p>

        <p><strong>What is Semantic Naming in Programming?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Semantic naming in programming refers to the practice of choosing
            names for variables, functions, classes, or other entities in a
            codebase that convey meaning about their purpose or functionality.
            The goal is to use names that provide clear and understandable
            information about the role and intent of the code element.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Descriptive Names: Semantic names are descriptive and reflect
                the purpose of the entity they represent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoiding Ambiguity: Names should be unambiguous, reducing the
                likelihood of misinterpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conveying Intent: The name itself should convey the intent or
                behavior of the associated code element.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consistency: Maintaining consistency in naming conventions
                across the codebase enhances overall clarity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Semantic naming is a fundamental principle in writing clean and
            understandable code. It allows developers to quickly grasp the
            functionality of different parts of the codebase, making it easier
            to maintain and collaborate on projects
        </p>
        <h2>Styling Text</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                font-size property sets the size of the text | vw unit, which
                means the "viewport width" => follow the size of the browser
                window.
            </li>
            <li>font-family property to specify the font of a text.</li>
            <li>
                text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and
                lowercase letters in a text
            </li>
            <li>
                text-align property specifies the horizontal alignment of text
                in an element
            </li>
            <li>line-height property specifies the height of a line</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What Values Can the Font Size Take in CSS?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Absolute Lengths</strong>: Numeric values followed by
                units like px (pixels), pt (points), cm (centimeters), etc.
                Example: font-size: 16px;
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Relative Lengths</strong>: Units relative to the parent
                element’s font size, such as em and rem. Example: font-size:
                1.5em; (1.5 times the parent element’s font size)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Percentages</strong>: Relative to the parent element’s
                font size. Example: font-size: 150%; (150% of the parent
                element’s font size)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keywords</strong>: Predefined values like medium, large,
                small, etc. Example: font-size: larger;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These values allow flexibility in specifying font sizes, catering to
            both absolute and relative measurements
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong
                >Are you looking to create a website with precise, high-quality
                design and layout?</strong
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            Pixel-perfect websites refer to those meticulously crafted to match
            the design mockups down to the individual pixel
        </p>

        <h2>Combining Selectors</h2>
        <p>
            CSS Combinators: A combinator is something that explains the
            relationship between the selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between
            the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
        </p>
        <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
            <li>child selector (>)</li>
            <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
            <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
        </ul>
